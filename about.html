			<h1>Our Mission To Serve</h1>
			<p>Our mission is to provide the sick, the displaced members, and, the blind into a temporary place of refreshment, comfort, and remove them from the high risk of hurting themselves and/or others. We strive to place the weary in a refuge place and give the disenfranchised victims of displacement and an opportunity to get back on their feet and lead them to a shelter free from harm</p>

			<p>Please join the fight and lead the technicians and revolutionaries who want to see this city we love so dearly called "the big apple" become infectionate with drive and charisma all over again</p>
